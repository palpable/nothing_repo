This part of the site is run only by the administrator at centralbanks.com.  This will allow for anyone to produce a road show and send it to specific members or the whole site.  For example if issuer x has a new deal and wants to send this out to all the members the administrator will do this for them.  If a central bank has an official release they want others to know we can release that.  In addition through this resource section we will be conducting surveys where the results can be quite useful to other members.  I.e. where do you see the dollar by years end? Where do you see oil by December 31?  The survey will be anonymous but the results will be a powerful piece of information.  The questions will only be sent to CB'S, SWF, and OI.  Results will be known to all participants first and released to paying members for a monthly subscription fee.</p>
